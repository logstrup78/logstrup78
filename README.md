# 👋 Hi, I’m Karsten

I build things that live on the web — sometimes elegant, sometimes chaotic, always educational.  
Assistant Lecturer, React tinkerer, and occasional wizard of CSS bugs.

## 🔭 Current Quests
- Teaching students to code without fear (except maybe fear of missing semicolons)
- Researching critical AI thinking and how humans behave when their chatbot goes rogue
- Designing interfaces that behave… politely

## 🌱 Skills Growing in the Wild
- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS… the classics)
- Accessibility, because everyone deserves a door into the web
- Cybersecurity curiosity — it started as a hobby, now it’s probably a career arc

## 🎮 Side Quests
- Magic: The Gathering strategist.  
  I lose games with style and occasionally win with even more style.
- Amateur historian of tiny objects: stamps, genealogy, and other delightful rabbit holes.

## 💬 If you talk to me about:
UX, clean code, pedagogy, AI ethics, or card combinations — I’ll likely forget the time and start sketching ideas.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I believe debugging is just digital archaeology.
